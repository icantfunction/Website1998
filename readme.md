Project Title: Tribute Page
This project is a simple tribute page dedicated to Jesus. It's a static webpage built using HTML and CSS.

Files
The project consists of two main files:

TributePage.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage. It includes a header with a title and an image.

styles.css: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the webpage. Currently, it includes styles for the image to ensure it fits within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.

HTML Structure
The HTML file contains a main section with an id of "main". Inside this main section, there's a header that includes a h1 title and an img tag for the image.

CSS Styles
The CSS file includes styles for the image. The image is set to take up 100% of the width of its container, and its height is set to auto to maintain the aspect ratio. The object-fit property is set to "contain" to ensure the image scales down to fit its container.

How to View
To view the webpage, simply open the TributePage.html file in any web browser.
